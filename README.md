# Facial Mask Detection

## Overview
The **Facial Mask Detection** project uses **Teachable Machine** and **JavaScript** to detect whether individuals are wearing masks. This web-based application leverages machine learning to provide real-time predictions based on webcam input, making it an excellent demonstration of AI integration in web development.

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Uses webcam input to detect masks on faces.
- **User Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for starting and stopping detection.
- **Prediction Display**: Shows predictions with confidence levels.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: Styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for mask detection.
- **Teachable Machine**: Machine learning model for mask detection.
- **TensorFlow.js**: Library for running machine learning models in the browser.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FacialMaskDetection.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd FacialMaskDetection
    ```
3. **Open `index.html` in your web browser**.

## Usage
Once the application is running, click the "Start Detection" button to begin mask detection. The system will use your webcam to show real-time predictions of whether individuals are wearing masks.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: Main file containing the HTML structure for the application.
